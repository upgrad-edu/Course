Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Kiran Mula
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, 
which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. 
Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
